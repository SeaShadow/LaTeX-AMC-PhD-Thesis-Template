  Abstract                 = {This book by Professor Neil Bose is an excellent interpretation of the hydrodynamics of the prediction of ship powering performance of various types of ship propulsors. It is based on extensive studies carried out by Professor Bose and his students over the last several years at the Memorial University of Newfoundland, Canada, and his long association with the Institute for Ocean Technology (IOT), National Research Council of Canada. As a result of his International Towing Tank Conference (ITTC) technical committee membership, he has captured the accepted international state-of-the-art of ship powering prediction. Professor Bose has extensively discussed most types of ship propulsors, including oscillating foils and wind-assisted propulsion devices. He has included a general discussion of ship resistance and the prediction of powering performance from model tests, primarily for conventional screw propellers. He has included the problems of screw propellers operating in ice, particularly with regard to strength. He has incorporated extensive lists of references and has included examples to be worked by the reader. As such, the book should be particularly useful to students and those responsible for making powering predictions, especially to those getting started in the field.},

  Abstract                 = {A waterjet propulsion system is used to propel ships, using a pump which produces a high speed jet. A standard waterjet installation can be divided into an inlet, a pump and a nozzle. For manoeuvring and reversing purposes an additional steering device can be integrated into the installation. The development of waterjet propulsion systems has made significant progress over the last few decades. Nowadays, commercial fast-ferries reach velocities of 50 knots, which is about 90 km/h. 
The theory to describe waterjet propulsion systems is derived from open propeller theory. The prediction of the thrust of a propeller is based on the momentum balance of a streamtube control volume. This thrust is then transferred though the shaft of the propeller to the hull of the ship. In contrast, for a waterjet propulsion system, forces are transferred to the hull not only through the shaft but also through the solid surface of the installation. A critical review learns that some assumptions made for open propellers are not valid for waterjets. 
The inflow to the waterjet pump is non-uniform. This results in a blade loading that varies during an impeller revolution. The cause and the effects of this non-uniform inflow have been investigated. Four contributing factors are identified for the development of a non-uniform velocity distribution just upstream of the pump. As a first cause, the water is ingested from below the hull of the ship, where a boundary layer with a non-uniform velocity distribution is present. Even at normal operating conditions, the water is subsequently retarded in the inlet, which results in an increase of the non-uniformity. Finally, the inflow passes the bend in the inlet and the protruding shaft which add to the increase in non-uniformity. It is concluded that the non-uniformity is the result of the accumulated vorticity in the flow. Due to this vorticity, a stable velocity distribution is found, and the typical velocity distribution is more or less independent of the actual design of the inlet. 
The investigations are based on numerical analyses of the flow through the complete waterjet installation. Selection of the numerical method is based on the capability to capture typical flow phenomena in a waterjet installation: high Reynolds number, time-dependency, and incompressible flow in a partially rotating frame of reference. Due to the high level of non-uniformity of the inflow, the ability to generate and transport vorticity in the flow is an important requirement, as well as the possibility to take into account the flow phenomena in the tip clearance region between the rotating blades and the stationary housing. 
A Reynolds averaged Navier-Stokes (BANS) method is chosen to perform all numerical analyses. The Reynolds-stresses are obtained using the two-equation k-[varepsilon] turbulence model. This turbulence model is known to produce an error near a stagnation point. An estimation of the influence of this error on the prediction of thrust and torque shows that the actual deviations are acceptable.},

  Abstract                 = {The prediction of waterjet propulsion performance using tow tank model testing has been a recent, ongoing area of research. The ITTC Waterjet Performance Prediction Specialist Committee was active in the 21st (Hoyt 1999), 22nd (Van Terwisga 2002), and 23rd (Van Terwisga 2005) ITTC committee period tasked with developing a model testing procedure for waterjet propulsion. It has been generally accepted that conventional shaft dynamometer propulsion tests are not suitable due to scale effects on pump performance, and often the use of surrogate model pumps. The committee adopted a control volume approach balancing momentum and energy through the waterjet system to arrive at system thrust,
thrust deduction, and delivered power. From assumptions made for the full scale pump efficiency, and inflow wake scaling, a prediction of full scale delivered power can be made. The committee identified areas of largest uncertainty as the accurate measure of the pump mass flow due to flow nonuniformity in the exhaust nozzles, the measure of hull resistance, and the establishment of the proper tow force. The ITTC standard locations for the flow through the waterjet are indicated in Figure 1. The inflow capture area is designated as Station 1(1a), one pump diameter ahead of the inlet tangency. Station 3 is located just ahead of the pump, and Station 6 is at the nozzle discharge.},
