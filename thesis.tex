%%   Style file to assist in generating a University of Tasmania PhD thesis
%%   in Mathematics. Contains all the required formatting options and 
%%   header/footer information that is set out in the Research Higher Degrees 
%%   Resource Handbook (2003 version)
%%
%%   This file should be easily modifiable to comply with
%%   minor formatting changes (such as the left margin width etc.)
%% 
%%   This style file is designed primarily for students of mathematics at UTas who
%%   are undertaking a PhD. However, only very minor changes need to be made to the 
%%   wording in a few places to use it as a template for an honours or Masters thesis 
%%   as well. In fact, there is no particular reason why this could be not used for, 
%%   say, an Arts thesis (Shock, Horror!) since it is mainly about the formatting and 
%%   less about the content. However, the heading and chapter structure has been chosen
%%   so as to be more in line with standard practice in the scientific streams. Again, 
%%   if you know what you're doing then it's really not that difficult to modify the style 
%%   file at the appropriate places. I have tried to comment it quite heavily so that 
%%   interested persons can see how it does all its work and, hopefully, make changes 
%%   that reflect personal tastes etc.

% thesis.tex (starting point of a UTas mathematics thesis)

% Note that the following defaults are also contained in the 'report' class
% (this is not exhaustive...see appropriate references for all options)
% 'oneside' mode...overide with 'twoside' to force output for two-sided printing.
% 'final' mode...overide with 'draft' to see linebreak malfunctioning.
% For example, to use two-sided printing one would declare the 'documentclass'
% as follows...
% '\documentclass[11pt,a4paper,twoside]{report}'
%
% Specific Mathematical options are as follows
% 'leqno' to force equation numbering on the left side of the page.
% 'fleqn' to force formulas to flush left (centered is the default).
% If 'fleqn' is specified then the left indent is controlled with '\mathindent'.
% i.e. '\setlength{\mathindent}{2.5cm}'

% Declare overall type of document (use 11pt report class on A4 paper).
\documentclass[11pt,a4paper]{report}

% If you want to generate an index you should include the following command
% which puts a makeindex command in the preamble. Additionally, you need to un-comment
% the file 'index' in the '\includeonly' command below and also include the 'index'
% file in the main document.
\makeindex
\PassOptionsToPackage{nottoc}{tocbibind}

% Include the style file which contains all the required formatting
% information that is set out in the Research Higher Degrees Resource
% Handbook (2003 version). NOTE: This file uses the following packages
% 'graphicx' for graphics manipulation
% 'fancyhdr' for nice headers and footers.
% 'makeidx' for generating the index
% 'tocbibind' for adding table of contents entries for bibliography, index etc.
% 'sectsty' for generating stylised chapter and section headings.
% 'lipsum' for generating dummy text.
% 'natbib' and 'har2nat' for bib citations.
% 'xcolor' color package.
% 'epstopdf' EPS to PDF conversion.
% You will need to make sure your LaTeX installation has these packages
% installed...else it wont work :(
\usepackage{Packages/mathphdthesis}

% Here you would include any additional packages that you want to use.
% You should make sure they don't clash with the above packages that
% are in use in the style file.

% Specify which pieces (other .tex files) you plan to include. You can comment
% out files that you will include later or have already finished to speed
% up TeX processing
